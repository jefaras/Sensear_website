                "answer": "Typically, consumer streaming platforms (like Spotify Free/Premium, YouTube, Apple Music, etc.) are licensed only for personal use, meaning they do not cover public performance rights in a commercial setting. You'll need a business license or properly licensed service to legally play music for your patrons."

                "question": "Why can't I just use my personal Spotify or Apple Music subscription?",
                "answer": "Personal subscriptions don't include public performance or commercial use rights. Using them in a public venue can violate copyright law and may lead to fines or legal complications. Commercial music services, by contrast, include the necessary licenses for public playback."

You must utilize it to legally broadcast or perform music in restaurants, bars, hotels, retail stores, etc. SensEar can help you navigate or secure these licenses for peace of mind."
